This manual will illustrate how the software works. Here you can find what the different options do and so forth.
You can at anytime direct yourself to the manual, anywhere in the program.

To navigate through the program, you use the arrows up and down, to choose which menu you want to select. 
When the arrow is on the menu you want to open, then you press enter.
You have, as said before, the ability to go back to the main menu or even quit the program at anytime. ((skriva hvussu ta√∞ hendur...))
