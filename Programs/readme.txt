The purpose of the program is to simulate the OEE of manufacturing processes in order to test organisational changes.

#Launch
To execute the program, you'll need a linux like operating system. E.g. Ubuntu.

Follow these steps to execute the program
1.  Unpack the zip file into the correct directory:
        \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\username\
2.  Open a linux based system and go the correct directory.
        Use the command "cd". (e.g. "cd folder_name/")
3.  Type:
        ./manu_sim.out
4.  If you get the error message "-bash: ./manu_sim.out: Permission denied", type the following:
        sudo chmod +x manu_sim.out

Go to step 3 again and the program should now be running.
